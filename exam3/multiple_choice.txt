except:

   a. `operator*`
   b. `operator+`
   c. `operator=`
-> d. All of these are implemented in an iterator.
   e. `operator==`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following code:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class dunno
    {
        public:

        int operator()(int f){
            return f>0 ? f : -f;
        }
    };

    void main()
    {
        float f = -123.45;
        dunno aObj;
        int something_f = aObj(f);
        cout << "f = " << f << " something_f = " << something_f << endl;
    }

What happens when you run the above code?

Choices:
   a. Compilation error
-> b. None of these is the correct output.
   c. Runtime error
   d. `f = -123.45 something_f = 123.45`
   e. `f = 123.45 something_f = -123.45`
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-> b. 128
   c. The answer cannot be determined from the information given.
   d. 64
   e. 256
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   b. `2, 252, 401, 398, 330, 344, 397, 363`
   c. `2, 399, 387, 219, 266, 382, 381, 278, 363`
-> d. `925, 202, 911, 240, 912, 245, 363`
   e. `935, 278, 347, 621, 399, 392, 358, 363`
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the AVL Tree built by inserting the following sequence of
integers, one at a time:

    5, 8, 9, 7, 6, 3

What is the element in root node?

Choices:
   a. 5
   b. 7
   c. 8
   d. None of these answers is correct.
-> e. 6.
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we would like to build a dictionary that maps a set of student
names (short strings) to a study group identifier. Which of the
following would work as a key function for our dictionary?

*Hint: the ordering of the students in the original set should not
matter.*

Choices:
   a. Sort and then concatenate the first letters of the students' names.
   b. Sort the students' names and then sum the values of the characters in
      their names.
-> c. None of the other answers are correct.
   d. Concatenate the names.
   e. Sort each name by character, then form a concatenation of all the sorted
      names.
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose the appropriate running time from the list below.

The variable $n$ represents the number of items (keys, data, or key/data
pairs) in the structure. In answering this question you should assume
the best possible implementation given the constraints, and also assume
that every array is sufficiently large to handle all items (unless
otherwise stated).

Worst case time to find the In Order Successor of a given key in a
Binary Search Tree (if it exists).

Choices:
-> a. $O(n)$
   b. $O(1)$
   c. $O(n^2)$
   d. $O(n\log n)$
   e. $O(\log n)$
Your answer was correct.
